## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the general instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section. Additionally, make sure to install any specific dependencies for the ANN implementation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-ann.txt


Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide_dataset_source_link]. Make sure to download and place the dataset in the data directory.

Preprocessing
Explain the data preprocessing steps here, such as handling missing values, scaling, etc.

Model Training
Describe the machine learning models used for predicting cardiovascular diseases, including the ANN architecture and how to train the ANN model.

ANN Implementation
The ANN implementation details can be found in the ann_model.py file. Customize the architecture, hyperparameters, and any other relevant configurations based on your specific use case.

Evaluation
Explain how the models, especially the ANN, are evaluated and the metrics used to assess their performance.

Results
Present the key results and findings, highlighting the contribution of the ANN model to the project.
